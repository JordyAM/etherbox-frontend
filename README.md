### `Technologies used`
- MERN stack (Mongoose, Express, React, Node.js)
- Socket.io (Backend message connection)
- Material-ui (Design)
- Animate.css (Message design)

### `Installation instruction`

The app can be found here: https://625d77b7803dea605ea0855a--spectacular-starship-ff91d2.netlify.app/
And the backend server here: https://rocky-peak-12032.herokuapp.com/

Simply open the backend server first to establish the connection with other people, share the app link with anyone you'd like to chat with and enter a message!

              react-scripts
              socket.io-client`
              
Along with these dependencies for the backend:
